To install a sample application into Eclipse (3.5):

* Create the sample application in your workspace:
2. Select __File__ -> __New__ -> __Project__, choose __Android Project__, and then click __Next__.
  3. Select "Create project from existing source".
  4. Choose __examples/showcase__. You should see the project properties populated.
  5. Click Finish to continue.

* Build the project: from the Project menu, select "Build Project".

* Run the application: from the Run menu, select "Run Configurations...".  Under Android Application, you can create a new run configuration: give it a name and select the simple Example project; use the default activity Launch Action.  See http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html#RunConfig for more details.
